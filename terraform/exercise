In this challenge, you will configure and deploy a highly available and secure website by using Amazon Web Services (AWS). First, you will establish a secure network environment by using a network access control list (ACL) and a security group, and then you will configure a redundant Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket to store static assets. Next, you will create a fleet of web servers running on an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance in a virtual private cloud (VPC) by using an Auto Scaling group. Finally, you will create an Application Load Balancer to use with the Auto Scaling group.
